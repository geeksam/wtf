That's better.

* Because a coworker suggested it, and I thought it was funny.
* Because I'm long overdue to learn how to use (or, in some cases, rusty on) things like Sinatra, Bundler, Heroku, and Capybara (especially now that it's eaten Steak).
* To see if I can make it into the Ruby Show's Hall of Fame. Er, again.
